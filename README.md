Node_Modules Not included, to run please run command:

#Note
I used the latest versions of AngularCLI.  There are some known bugs with UseAngularCliServer in Startup.cs
I implemented a work around to fix this.

Additionally due to some issues with the latest Angular, the first Debug IIS Express run, may fail to build.  
It should be successful on second build
